Synth keyboard scanner


Arduino nano:
 3 output pins to pins a0-a2 of a 74HCT138 one-of-8 decoder. Each output (driven low) scans a set of 8 keys
 3 output pins to pins s0-s2 of a 74HCT354 one-of-8 data selector.
 1 output pin to the OE pin of the 74HCT354
 1 input pin from the data out (Y) pin of the 74HCT354
     ==> up to 64 keys
     ==> keyboard has 44 keys (6 rows, one row has only 4 keys)

 scan code
	forever
		timing delay() --- scan every 10 ms
		set kscan_en HIGH to enable data from keyboard scan
		foreach column 0..COLMAX
			output the column number ('138 a0-a2) to drive the column enable low
			for each row 0..ROWMAX
				output the row number ('354 s0-s2) to select the row
				calculate key index
	            if key's counter is >0, decrement it and ignore the key
				else
					read the key state
					if state is LOW (pressed)
						if stored keystate is 0
							set stored state to 1
							set key's count to 20 ms
							send key press event
					else
						if stored keystate is 1
							set stored state to 0
							set key's count to 20 ms
							send key release event
		set kscan_en LOW to switch '354 output to 3-state
