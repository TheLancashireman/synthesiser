# Digital noise generator using ATTiny microcontroller

## Pinout

* Pin 1 = Not connected
* Pin 2 = Not connected
* Pin 3 = Not connected
* Pin 4 = GND
* Pin 5 = Not connected
* Pin 6 = PB1 - noise output
* Pin 7 = Not connected
* Pin 8 = VCC

## Operation

A 64-bit LFSR generates a pseudo-random bit stream. The bit stream repeats after 2^64-1 bits.

The bits have a frequency of approximately 500 kHz
