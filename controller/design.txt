Synth keyboard scanner


Arduino nano:
 4 output pins to pins s0-s3 of a set of 74hc4067 analogue mux/demux ICs
 n analogue input pins (one from each 74hc4067)

 scan code
	forever
		timing delay() --- scan every 100 ms
		foreach channel 0..15
			output the channel number (s0-s3) to select the channels
			delay(settling time)
			for each ADC input 0..nADC-1
				read anaogue value
				if different from last time OR last transmit > poll time ago
					send midi command
